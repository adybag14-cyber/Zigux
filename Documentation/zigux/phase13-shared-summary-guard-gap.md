# Phase 13 Shared Summary Guard Handoff

This note records the closure of the old missing-checker gap.

The shipped guard is `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`.

## Status

- `PHASE13_STATUS=active`
- `PHASE13_SHARED_SUMMARY_GUARD=shipped`
- stable guard: `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`
- companion handoff check: `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.py`
- blocked route family remains outside the shared handle: current `master` rematerializes `zigux/Makefile`, but `make -C zigux phase13-validate` and `make -C zigux phase13` still remain repo-reality-gap route names

## What Closed

The old gap was the absence of one narrow guard that could keep the shared Phase 13 contributor wording honest across the phase-local workflow and release notes.

That gap is now closed through these shipped surfaces:

- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-contributor-workflow-guide.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-release-coordination-matrix.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-shared-helper-lane-sequencing.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.md`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`

## Remaining Follow-Up

The remaining follow-up is no longer a generic README-and-tests-root refresh. Fresh authenticated file checks in this run narrow the next same-lane work to the tests-root packet and its dedicated alignment checker.

Fresh authenticated file checks in this run keep `Documentation/zigux/phase13-notifier-list-survey.md`, `zigux/helpers/list_view.zig`, and `zigux/helpers/hlist_view.zig` materialized on current `master`, so they should stay recorded as returned adjacent notifier evidence rather than as repo-reality gaps.

Fresh authenticated file checks in this run also resolve `zigux/Makefile`, so keep the file itself explicit as returned build-surface evidence while leaving only `make -C zigux phase13-validate` and `make -C zigux phase13` in the remaining repo-reality-gap route list.

Fresh authenticated file checks in this run now also keep `zigux/tests/phase13_devres_dma_coherent.zig` materialized on current `master`, while `Documentation/zigux/phase13-landlock-syscalls-survey.md`, `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls.zig`, `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls_reviewability.zig`, and `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls_manifest.json` still return missing. That means the next truthful shared-subsystems follow-through is to refresh `zigux/tests/README.md` and `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-tests-readme-alignment.py` together so they stop treating the missing direct Landlock syscall packet as shipped tests-root evidence and stop leaving the returned direct devres DMA replay in the gap bucket.

Keep these paths recorded as repo-reality gaps until current `master` rematerializes them:

- `make -C zigux phase13-validate`
- `make -C zigux phase13`
- `scripts/zigux/validate-phase13-release.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-devres-packet-alignment.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-landlock-ruleset-packet.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-notifier-packet.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-notifier-priority-signal.py`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_build.zig`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_notifier_list_manifest.json`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_notifier_list_reviewability.zig`
- `include/zigux/notifier_abi.h`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-landlock-syscalls-survey.md`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls.zig`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls_reviewability.zig`
- `zigux/tests/phase13_landlock_syscalls_manifest.json`

## Review Use

1. Run `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`.
2. Run `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.py`.
3. Keep `Documentation/zigux/phase13-notifier-list-survey.md`, `zigux/helpers/list_view.zig`, and `zigux/helpers/hlist_view.zig` explicit as returned adjacent notifier evidence without turning them into part of the stable shared replay handle.
4. Keep `zigux/Makefile` explicit as a returned file, but keep `make -C zigux phase13-validate`, `make -C zigux phase13`, and the still-missing notifier and build companions recorded as repo-reality gaps rather than promoting them into shipped contributor workflow evidence.
5. Treat the next same-lane follow-through as a paired `zigux/tests/README.md` plus `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-tests-readme-alignment.py` truthfulness refresh so the tests-root packet matches the returned direct devres DMA replay and the still-missing direct Landlock syscall companions before widening into broader docs-root or helper-local work.

## Boundaries

- This note does not reopen the old missing-checker claim.
- This note does not close the broader Phase 13 tranche.
- This note does not promote adjacent notifier evidence into a fifth helper family.

# Phase 13 Shared Summary Guard Handoff

This note records the closure of the old missing-checker gap.

The shipped guard is `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`.

## Status

- `PHASE13_STATUS=active`
- `PHASE13_SHARED_SUMMARY_GUARD=shipped`
- stable guard: `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`
- companion handoff check: `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.py`
- blocked route family remains outside the shared handle: `zigux/Makefile`, `make -C zigux phase13-validate`, and `make -C zigux phase13`

## What Closed

The old gap was the absence of one narrow guard that could keep the shared Phase 13 contributor wording honest across the phase-local workflow and release notes.

That gap is now closed through these shipped surfaces:

- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-contributor-workflow-guide.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-release-coordination-matrix.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-shared-helper-lane-sequencing.md`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.md`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`

## Remaining Follow-Up

The remaining follow-up is broader README and tests-root packet refresh work, not another missing guard.

Keep these paths recorded as repo-reality gaps until current `master` rematerializes them:

- `zigux/Makefile`
- `make -C zigux phase13-validate`
- `make -C zigux phase13`
- `scripts/zigux/validate-phase13-release.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-devres-packet-alignment.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-landlock-ruleset-packet.py`
- `scripts/zigux/check-phase13-notifier-priority-signal.py`
- `Documentation/zigux/phase13-notifier-list-survey.md`

## Review Use

1. Run `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-surfaces.py`.
2. Run `python3 scripts/zigux/check-phase13-shared-summary-guard-gap.py`.
3. Keep the Makefile-backed route family recorded as repo-reality gaps rather than promoting it into shipped contributor workflow evidence.
4. Treat broader docs-root, scripts-root, and tests-root refresh as a separate same-lane follow-up step.

## Boundaries

- This note does not reopen the old missing-checker claim.
- This note does not close the broader Phase 13 tranche.
- This note does not promote adjacent notifier evidence into a fifth helper family.

# Phase 12 Raw GitHub Coverage Survey

This note records the public-read fallback split for the active Phase 12 release packet.

It is a compact fallback overview, not a new replay surface and not a commit-pinned artifact itself.

## Status
- `PHASE12_STATUS=active`
- scope: keep the mixed public fallback story explicit across the shipped Phase 12 driver and libbpf packet without promoting shared-tree anchors into dedicated fallback artifacts
- release-order companion: `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-sequencing.md`
- closure companion: `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-closure-checklist.md`
- readiness companion: `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-readiness-survey.md`
- coordination companion: `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-coordination-matrix.md`

## Fallback Split
- commit-pinned fallback artifacts:
  - `Documentation/zigux/phase12-nvme-pci-raw-github-fallback-map.md`
  - `Documentation/zigux/phase12-virtio-scsi-raw-github-fallback-catalog.md`
- shared-tree-only anchors:
  - `Documentation/zigux/phase12-virtio-net-survey.md`
  - `Documentation/zigux/phase12-libbpf-segment-survey.md`
- rule: keep this two-versus-two split explicit in shared PMO wording and do not promote the shared-tree anchors into commit-pinned fallback artifacts unless dedicated files actually land

## Review Use
- reread this note beside `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-sequencing.md`, `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-closure-checklist.md`, `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-readiness-survey.md`, and `Documentation/zigux/phase12-release-coordination-matrix.md` whenever fallback wording changes
- rerun `python3 scripts/zigux/check-build-only-phase12-surface.py` before widening fallback claims or release wording
- keep the current smoke-first replay order explicit through `zig build smoke --build-file zigux/tests/phase12_build.zig --summary all`, `make -C zigux phase12-smoke`, `zig build test --build-file zigux/tests/phase12_build.zig --summary all`, and `make -C zigux phase12`

## Anti-Overlap Notes
- `Documentation/zigux/phase12-libbpf-heavy-consumer-lane-sequencing.md` should be reread beside this shared fallback overview whenever shared Phase 12 libbpf ownership wording changes
- `Documentation/zigux/phase12-complex-driver-lane-sequencing.md` remains the separate driver-only anti-overlap companion

## Boundaries
- This note must not imply a shared `validate-phase12.py`, `check-phase12-*.py`, focused-libbpf-only replay, cross-build replay, or `phase12-validate` route that current `master` does not ship.
- This note must not imply active delivery against `net/core/skbuff.c`, `kernel/workqueue.c`, or `kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c`.
- Treat this file as a compact fallback reminder only; the concrete survey, slice, manifest, smoke-route, and reviewability details remain in the shipped Phase 12 packet itself.

## Next Bounded Step
If the fallback split changes later, update this note together with the release-order, closure, readiness, coordination, driver anti-overlap, and libbpf anti-overlap companions so the shared Phase 12 packet keeps one truthful public-read story.

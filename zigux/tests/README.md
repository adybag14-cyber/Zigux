# zigux/tests

This directory is the home of reusable Zigux parity and differential validation harnesses.

Purpose

  * hold shared harness logic before subsystem-specific tests spread through the tree
  * keep product-facing validation code separate from ad hoc experiments
  * provide the checks for helper parity, ABI assertions, and rollback readiness

Key entrypoints
  * `zigux/tests/build.zig`
  * roadmap-backed Phase 4 differential-gate destinations still missing on current `master`: `zigux/tests/atomic64_diff.zig` and `zigux/tests/runtime_atomic64_diff.zig`
  * current direct-readback Phase 4 rollback packet:
    `Documentation/zigux/phase4-reversible-delivery-evidence.md`
    `Documentation/zigux/review-checklist.md`
    `zigux/tests/README.md`
    `scripts/zigux/check-phase4-repo-reality-warning.py`
    `scripts/zigux/check-phase4-reversible-delivery-pins.py`
  * Current direct-readback dedicated local-only perf checker: `scripts/zigux/check-phase4-perf-baseline-packet.py`
  * Current direct-readback dedicated local-only perf companion members: `zigux/tests/phase4_perf_baseline_manifest.json`, `zigux/tests/phase4_perf_baseline_survey.zig`
  * repo-reality warning for the broader Phase 4 validator, lab-matrix, and bitmap-diff packet: authenticated contents reads on current `master` still return missing for `Documentation/zigux/phase4-gate-evidence.md`, `Documentation/zigux/phase4-validation-matrix.md`, `scripts/zigux/check-phase4-gate-evidence.py`, `scripts/zigux/check-phase4-remaining-gap-matrix.py`, `scripts/zigux/validate-phase4.py`, `zigux/tests/phase4_build.zig`, `zigux/tests/bitmap_diff.zig`, and `zigux/tests/phase4_bitmap_live_helper_replay.zig`
  * public current-`master` fallback rereads can still expose older broader Phase 4 companions, but keep that fallback visibility separate from authenticated direct-readback proof in this tests-root reminder until the same files return through direct contents reads
  * Phase 4 follow-through should treat the stale `PHASE4_REVERSIBLE_DELIVERY_LAST_KNOWN_*` lines in `Documentation/zigux/phase4-reversible-delivery-evidence.md` as historical provenance for that missing broader packet until fresh current-head evidence lands
  * The Phase 4 repo-reality warning in `zigux/tests/README.md` should stay open until that broader validator, lab-matrix, bitmap-diff companions, or the roadmap-backed `atomic64_diff` pair are directly readable again
  * current shared Phase 4 ownership reminder: keep rollback-owner wording, artifact-diff contract references, and remaining-gap truthfulness aligned with `Documentation/zigux/phase4-reversible-delivery-evidence.md` instead of reconstructing the broader packet from older route names alone
  * historical Phase 4 route names such as the parked kprobe and `test_fsmount` survey companions, the validator-first routes, and the direct local-only perf routes stay owned by the reversible-delivery handoff note until the dedicated exact-pin refresh or a broader republish makes those companion blob values directly readable again
